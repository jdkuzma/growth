***BEFORE YOU BEGIN:
This code uses the "Leap Motion for Processing" library by Darius Morawiec. It can be found here:
https://github.com/voidplus/leap-motion-processing

This code was developed for Processing 2.0.1. It will run in 2.0.2, however I have found that transparency effects may not work depending on your system.
